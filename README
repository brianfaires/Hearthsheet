Overview
Orange cells are instructions.  Purple cells are user-editable.  Everything else is locked to prevent accidental editing, but there are no passwords on the locks.

The high-level workflow for the whole sheet is:
1.	List all decks on the Log tab.  Update occasionally.
2.	Input VS win rates on Priors tab.  Update occasionally.
3.	Log games on Log tab.
4.	When ready to analyze data, press the big button on the Log tab.
5.	Deck sheets are created/updated, look at these for info on each deck.
6.	Meta sheet will break down a given meta.  Two modes: Log-based meta (for ladder), and manual meta (for tourney)
7.	Analyze conquest lineups on Conquest tab.

Known bugs/future enhancements:
1.	Conditional formatting sometimes screws up due to a bug in Excel 2010 with large workbooks.  If formatting looks weird after doing an update, Unprotect the sheet, then add and remove a conditional format to any cell.  This will update all the conditional formats and fix the broken ones.
2.	Pull win rates from Deck sheets, not Priors tab.
3.	Colors on log sheet aren’t consistent.

Breakdown of each sheet:

Log
The place you log games, and some high-level config stuff that can usually be ignored.
•	Logs are straightforward, just add them.
•	Add new decks in the table on the right.  This is the master list of decks, and some copies of it are on other tabs.  Update it here, and the others will update automatically.
•	When you press the big button, there will be a 20-30 sec delay, and the Meta tab will be opened on completion.  Press Escape to abort or debug.  Afterward, a deck sheet is generated for each deck.  They’ll be sorted according to the number of games logged.
•	The config sections are used to limit how deck sheets are created/colored, and to specify which games from the log are ignored.

Priors
Enter win rates that aren’t based on your own data.  (e.g. copy win rates straight from Vicious Syndicate.) These act as a starting point for computing true win rates, and as more data is gathered, these rates matter less.
•	The empty purple cells will be assumed to be 50-50 matchups.
•	The win rate in each cell applies to the deck listed on the same row, when playing against the deck listed in the column.
•	It’s always safe to hit the Cleanup button.  You should do this after adding/removing decks on the Log tab, because it will resize the table accordingly.  It will also check the table for errors, and auto-populate any win rate it can (e.g. if you specify Deck A vs B is 55%, it will fill in 45% for B vs A).

Meta
Used to see which decks are best against a given meta.  You can manually edit the values in B12:S17 to construct a custom meta, or you can pull the most recent games from the Log tab to see the meta you’ve been playing against on ladder.  In either case, a button press is required to load the appropriate data, update win rates on each deck sheet, and list the best meta decks.  Data on this sheet is:
•	Raw counts of each deck
•	Percent of total meta for each deck
•	Class vs class win rates
•	Percent of total meta for each class
•	All decks sorted by frequency
•	A list of which decks will perform best in the specified meta, based on win rates from deck sheets

Conquest
Used to compare different conquest lineups, and calculate the optimal strategy (i.e. unexploitable) for picking decks.  Each strategy is ‘mixed’, so you would randomly pick each deck with probability equal to the values listed.  (e.g. “.3, .2, .5” means pick Deck A 30% of the time, Deck B 20%, and Deck C half the time.)  Usually you will fill in your lineup at the top of the table, then list several opponent lineups, then click Process All Matchups.

You can also play around with the stuff at the bottom to see how changing decks or win rates will affect a specific matchup.  “Pull Win Rates” will load the rates for the listed decks from the appropriate deck sheets.  “Process Matchup” will ignore the deck names and just do the game theory calculations for the given win rates.

Deck Sheets
One of these is generated for each deck (based on config in the Log tab).  They are essentially read-only.  The color of the tab is based on how many games have been logged with that deck (red/yellow sheets have fewer games and might not be significant). Each deck sheet shows:
•	Total number of games logged with this deck
•	Expected win rate in the meta currently configured on the Meta tab
•	A raw win/loss count vs each other deck
•	The default win rate for each matchup, pulled from the Priors tab
•	An expected win rate vs each other deck.  This is done by merging the default win rate with the wins/losses that have been logged.  Config in cell N12.
•	Best matchups, sorted by win rate
•	All win rates versus decks in the current meta (from Meta tab)
